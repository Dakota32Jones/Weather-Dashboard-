Week-6-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a weather application that could retrieve data from a 3rd party api and display weather data from different geographical locations. This project was built to show my understanding with local storage, as well as 3rd party api's. This application solves a problem, where someone can go to the application and pull up previously searched cities or type in new cities and show the current forecast as well as the 5 day forecast. During this project, I learned how to use bootstrap, javascript and local storage as well as a 3rd party api from openweathermaps.
